"HelpConnect" develops a web application to connect elderly people with volunteers who provide companionship, assistance, and emotional support. Project objectives include the design and development of a web application for creating profiles, booking services, and joining a community, enabling clients to specify their needs and preferences, allowing clients to optionally pay volunteers for their services, and assessing the impact of the web application on service delivery. In this project, two target users (client and volunteer) are provided with editable fields and ratings systems in their user profiles, services can be booked, a news feed and comment section will be developed, and surveys and feedback forms will be used to evaluate the web application's effectiveness. As a result of the project, the elderly will receive better care, receive user approval, and experience social cohesion, which in turn will enhance their emotional well-being and improve their quality of life. The hardware and software requirements for the project include specific laptop models and software tools such as Microsoft Word, Diagram.net, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and XAMPP Server. In addition to improving the quality of life and social welfare of elderly people, the project uses technology and innovation.
